##   Services Offered

* **Private Pilot License (PPL):** Learn the fundamentals of flight in Cessna 172/Piper PA-28 aircraft (both traditional "six-pack" and modern G1000 avionics).
* **Instrument Rating (IR):** Master the skills and procedures for flying in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC).
* **Multi-Engine Instructor (MEI):** Train to become a multi-engine pilot in the Beechcraft BE76 Duchess.
* **Exciting New Service: Affordable Multi-Engine Time Building!** Looking to build valuable multi-engine flight hours without breaking the bank? I now offer affordable multi-engine time building opportunities in the Beechcraft BE76 Duchess!

    **Here's what makes this service stand out:**

    * **Cost-Effective:** Maximize your flight time investment with competitive rates for multi-engine time building. I understand it can be difficult to find affordable multi-engine time building opportunities. Many pilots struggle to find partners or suitable aircraft for rent.
    * **Dual Instruction Included:** Unlike purely renting an aircraft, you'll have the benefit of a Certified Flight Instructor (MEI) onboard. This means you can log **dual received** for every hour flown, enhancing your skills and experience under guidance. I ensure meticulous and accurate logbook entries that document the training, maneuvers, and conditions of each flight. This thoroughness provides **"bulletproof"** documentation, giving you confidence that your logbook will withstand scrutiny during any future airline audit.
    * **Night and Cross-Country Experience:** Take advantage of opportunities to gain valuable experience in **night flying** and **cross-country procedures**.
    * **Flexible Scheduling:** I specialize in accommodating your busy schedule with availability for **night and weekend time building**.
    * **Beechcraft BE76 Duchess:** Build your hours in a well-maintained and capable twin-engine aircraft.
    * **Reduced Costs:** I also understand that aircraft rental can be expensive. With my program, you don't have to pay an instructor fee, and in many cases, you'll pay a reduced rental rate compared to renting the aircraft on your own.
    * **MEI Signed Logbook:** The cost of building multi-engine time with me is comparable to splitting costs with another ME pilot. However, as an MEI, I provide the added benefit of signing your logbook, which is crucial for verifying your experience.  I prioritize meticulous and accurate logbook entries, ensuring they are **"bulletproof"** and will withstand scrutiny during any future airline audit, so you don't need to worry about your multi-engine time being questioned during 121 airline logbook audit.

    **Perfect for:**

    * Pilots working towards their Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) certificate.
    * Individuals seeking to gain multi-engine experience for career advancement.
    * Anyone wanting to enhance their proficiency in multi-engine operations.

    Don't let cost be a barrier to achieving your multi-engine goals. To get a personalized time-building plan, **text me with your pilot certificate level, the number of hours you need, and your desired start date.** Multi-engine time building is offered at \$1** per hour.
* **Flight Reviews:** Stay current and safe with comprehensive flight reviews.
* **Affordable Multi-Engine Time Building:** Build valuable multi-engine flight hours efficiently and affordably in Beechcraft BE76 Duchess.
